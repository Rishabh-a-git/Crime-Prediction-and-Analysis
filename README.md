# Crime-Prediction-and-Analysis

This project aims to predict victim information and identify prevalent crime types using machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement

1. Predicting victim information: Crime incidents impact victims and their families. Predicting victim age, gender, and ethnicity can assist law enforcement agencies    in investigations and victim support services.
2. Identifying common crime types: Understanding prevalent crime types helps allocate resources and implement proactive policing measures.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises reported crimes in Los Angeles from 2020 to the present, with 686,437 rows and 28 columns. It can be accessed through: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

## The jupyter file includes:

1. Pre-processing: Cleaned and prepared the crime dataset by handling null values, selecting relevant features, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Classification and Prediction: Utilized classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors) for crime type classification and regression      models (Ridge, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for predicting victim information.
3. Data Visualization: Visualized crime trends, top crimes, and victim characteristics using graphs and charts.
